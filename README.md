## My process

- This React application manages a list of friends and allows users to add new friends, view their balances, and split bills with selected friends.
- The `App` component manages the state for showing the add friend form, the list of friends, and the selected friend for bill splitting.
- When a friend is selected, it displays a form to split the bill, where users can input the bill amount, their own expense, and select who is paying.
- Upon submission, the bill is split accordingly, and the balances are updated.
- The application components are structured to efficiently handle state updates and provide a user-friendly interface for managing friendships and expenses.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-Responsive Design
- JavaScript - Scripting language
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is a class exercise implementing things taught so far on react

### Continued development
